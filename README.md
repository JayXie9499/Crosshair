# Crosshair

A simple crosshair overlay.

Create a `config.yml` within the same directory as `Crosshair.exe` to customize the crosshair style.

## config.yml

Example:

```yaml
type: dot # Supported types: dot, cross
size: 3.5
thickness: 2 # Crosshair thickness for type: cross
borderWidth: 1
color: "#FF0000"
```
